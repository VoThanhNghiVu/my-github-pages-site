This is a simple static website created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and Markdown. Below are some of the GitHub Flavored Markdown features used:

You can create headers by using `#` symbols. The more `#` symbols, the smaller the header.

- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
